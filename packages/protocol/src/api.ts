// The read API wire surface — response envelopes for API §1 Reads (BRO-1812).
//
// These are the typed responses the runtime's read routes return and the client
// hydrates from (`/api/tree`, `/api/node/:id`, `/api/board`, …). They are
// COMPOSED from the index row shapes (index-schema.ts) — the read API is "cheap
// index queries" (API §1), so it ships the derived `node`/`session`/`event`/
// `gate`/`schedule` rows almost verbatim, with one transform:
//
//   The internal sync bookkeeping (`deletedAt`) is STRIPPED — a tombstoned row
//   never crosses the wire (API §1 "only live rows … tombstones are internal").
//   Every route filters `deletedAt IS NULL` server-side and returns a `Live*`.
//
// What this surface is NOT:
//   - It is NOT `WorkItem` (work-item.ts). `WorkItem` is the fully-DERIVED read
//     projection (title fallback, `look`, `worker`, `run`, `gateId`, initiative/
//     project ancestry) — that derivation is the projector's job (BRO-1775). The
//     read API serves the raw live rows; the client store projects them.
//   - Timestamps stay NUMERIC (epoch ms), exactly as the index stores them. The
//     ISO-8601 conversion (`WorkItem.updatedAt: string`) is again the projector's.
//
// Canon: API.md §1 Reads / §4 Error shape, DATA-MODEL §B.5 (the reactive queries),
// canon-amendments D-ORDER (the board attention order).

 * its children, so a client folds the tree from `parentId` in one pass); the board
 * and the tree both derive from this set.

 * the client's node→session join derives each card's run branch, open gate, and
 * session id at LOAD, in the single hydrate fetch. Without them the join is empty:
 * cards render runless and the gate verbs are dead (no `gateId`) even against a live
 * runtime (BRO-1941). The per-node `/api/node/:id` (`NodeDetail`) carries the same
 * rows scoped to one node; the tree carries all of them. Gates join to sessions via
 * `gate.sessionId` (a node has no direct gate column). Clients key both by id, so no

 *   kill (`run.killed`). The scarce resource trends DOWN as autonomy improves.
 * - `activeRuns` — a receipt: how many runs are still live at `until`.
 * - `segments` / `notches` — the scoreboard bar geometry in POSITIONAL percent of the window (0–100): a
 *   timeline of the unsupervised stretches + the look marks. This is layout position, NOT a progress %.
 * - `label` — a canonical single-line plain-voice rendering ("2h 14m unsupervised · 3 looks"; no `%`) for
 *   single-line surfaces (a tooltip, a notification, a CLI). The sidebar scoreboard does NOT use it — it
