// Gate queue — the derived attention view + verdict semantics + the grace window.
//
// The gate queue is a DERIVED VIEW over nodes in the attention set (state ∈
// {review, blocked} = `ATTENTION_STATES`) — never a separate store. Its comparator
// REUSES the shared board axis (`compareByAttention`, D-ORDER, DATA-MODEL §B.5) for
// cross-group order — it does NOT re-order the whole board on its own (the board's
// non-attention groups carry their own within-group recency key; see `compareGateQueue`).
// This seam pins: the comparator, the `data-gate` card payload, the verdict→verb +
// terminating semantics, the closed `GateKind`, and the grace-window undo state machine.
//
// Cross-seam (single-source, learned from BRO-1764's review):
//   - membership REFERENCES `ATTENTION_STATES` (state.ts) — never a duplicate set;
//   - the comparator COMPOSES `compareByAttention` (plain-voice.ts) — never re-declared;
//   - `GateKind` is widened in its home (work.ts); this file imports it;
//   - `GateVerdict` (state.ts) + `GateLook` (work-item.ts) are imported, not redefined;
//   - `MaestroDataParts.gate` is added by MODULE AUGMENTATION of chat.ts (BRO-1776 left
//     it out) — no edit to chat.ts; the barrel `export * from "./gate"` makes it reach
//     the composition site.
//
// Canon: DATA-MODEL §B.3 gate / §B.5, PATTERNS §6, FLOWS §F5, porting-notes
// §MccMaestroLoopV2 (grace window), START-HERE §5 seam 3, canon-amendments D-GATE.
