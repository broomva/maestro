 * reachable from the key by a *flow* transition (FLOWS F1–F8). Every edge is
 * grounded in a specific flow:
 *
 *  - proposed → reviewing|triggered|running  orchestrator grooming + dispatch (F2, F6)
 *  - reviewing → triggered                    pre-dispatch review resolves (F6)
 *  - triggered → running                      dispatch (F2)
 *  - running → review                         verify pass + gate:human → gate (F4→F5)
 *  - running → done                           verify pass + gate:auto merges (F4) [guarded]
 *  - running → blocked                         spawn fail (F2) / stop condition (F3) / kill (F8)
 *  - blocked → triggered                       human unblocks, redispatch (F9)
 *  - review → done                             approve verdict (F5) [guarded]
 *  - review → triggered                        revise / send back (F5)
 *  - review → canceled                         block verdict, terminal (F5, D-GATE)
 *
 * The human override intent `set_state` (API.md §1, "human override, audited")
 * deliberately BYPASSES this machine — it is audited at the API layer, not
 * routed through `transition`. Cancelling queued/blocked work (there is no flow
 * intent for it) goes through that override.
 *
 * Two edges are additionally guarded (see `transition`):
 *  - review → done   requires an `approve` verdict (PATTERNS §7 invariant;
 *                    FLOWS F5: approve is the ONLY path review→done when gate:human).
 *  - running → done  is legal ONLY under gate:auto (D-AUTODONE; FLOWS F4). Under
 *                    gate:human a clean run parks at `review`, never auto-done.
