# bstack — Prompts Library Integration

bstack treats the broomva.tech prompts library as a **shared knowledge surface across agents**, not a private repository. Every bstack-driven workspace gets two things from this surface:

1. **Reusable directives** — versioned, parameterized prompts that any agent can pull and apply (code review, deep research, repo audits, refactoring, etc.).
2. **An evaluation engine** — every pull and every completion writes a typed row to `prompt_invocation`, so the platform learns which prompts compound and which decay. The agent reading this *closes its own evaluation loop* by following the mandate below.

This file is the canonical bstack guide. The skill-level mandate lives in the `broomva-cli` skill SKILL.md and is reproduced here for reflexive reference.

## When a bstack-driven agent should reach for the prompt library

Use existing prompts when you're about to do work that has a **named pattern in the library**. Common cases:

| User asks for / Agent needs | Reach for |
|---|---|
| Code review of a diff or file | `code-review-agent` |
| Deep architectural analysis of a new repo / area | `codebase-deep-analysis` or `ecosystem-repo-architect` |
| First-principles platform redesign | `ai-native-platform-architect` |
| Rigorous "think harder" framing | `deep-thinking-directive` |
| Multi-source research with citations | `deep-research-agent` |
| Autonomous PR review + resolution | `pr-review-agent` |
| Security attack-surface assessment | `security-attack-surface` |
| Refactor a brittle data pipeline | `secure-refactor-agent` |
| Brutally honest strategic advice | `brutally-honest-advisor` |
| Bootstrapping the agent harness in a fresh repo | `bstack-control-harness-bootstrap` |

Discover what's available with `broomva prompts list --metrics --sort skill_invokes` — the highest-invocation prompts are the proven ones.

**Do not reach for a prompt when**: the work is one-off, the directive would be longer than the work itself, or you'd be reinventing existing context that the surrounding session already carries.

## The mandate (5 steps, MANDATORY)

When you do reach for a prompt, follow these steps exactly. Skipping step 4 breaks the evaluation loop and the library can't learn.

### Step 1 — Tag the session as a skill invocation

Once per session (terminal or agent):

```bash
export BROOMVA_SOURCE=skill
```

This sets `source='skill'` on every invocation row. Without it, the row would carry `source='cli'` and the evals dashboard would conflate skill-driven runs with terminal-driven ones. Terminal users default to `cli`; programmatic wrappers should set `api`.

### Step 2 — Pull the prompt with `--json`

```bash
broomva prompts pull <slug> --json 2>&1 | tee /tmp/broomva-last.json
```

The CLI writes the prompt body to `<slug>.md` (or `-o path`) and emits a single JSON line on stderr:

```json
{"invocation_id":"<uuid>","prompt_slug":"<slug>","prompt_version":"<v>","posted":true}
```

Capture the `invocation_id` — you'll need it for step 4. The pull fires `POST /api/invocations` server-side; that row's `status='pulled'` until you complete it.

### Step 3 — Use the prompt body

Treat the body as your system instructions for the task the user gave you. Apply it directly to the work. Do not paraphrase or shorten the body unless the user explicitly asks for a condensed form.

### Step 4 — Complete the invocation (MANDATORY)

After you finish the work the prompt asked for:

```bash
broomva prompts complete <invocation_id> \
  --status completed \
  --model <your-model-name> \
  --latency-ms <wall-clock-ms> \
  --tokens-in <input-tokens> \
  --tokens-out <output-tokens>
```

This PATCHes the row to `status='completed'` and the server computes `cost_usd` from the model + token counts via the static pricing table. Use `--status failed` if you could not complete the work and include `--error-message <reason>`.

**This is how prompts get evaluated.** A `pulled` row that never gets completed is invisible to the eval engine. The 24h sweeper eventually flips it to `abandoned`, but that's a quality signal, not a useful run.

### Step 5 — Capture feedback if the user gave it

If the user gave a clear thumbs up/down in the conversation:

```bash
broomva prompts feedback <invocation_id> \
  --slug <slug> \
  --signal up \
  --text "<user's words, max 2000 chars>"
```

Optional but high-signal — explicit feedback weights more than pass-rate in the eval ranking.

## Discovery — finding the right prompt

```bash
# Browse all prompts (basic table)
broomva prompts list

# Find the most-invoked prompts (proven by usage)
broomva prompts list --metrics --sort skill_invokes

# Filter by category or tag
broomva prompts list --category agent-instructions
broomva prompts list --tag security
broomva prompts list --model claude-opus-4.5

# Get one prompt
broomva prompts get <slug>          # rendered with frontmatter
broomva prompts get <slug> --raw    # body only
broomva prompts get <slug> --json   # full JSON

# Browse the web UI
open https://broomva.tech/prompts
```

If no existing prompt fits, write one — and **push it to the library so future sessions inherit it**:

```bash
broomva prompts push <file.md> --create
```

The MDX file needs frontmatter (`title`, `category`, `model`, `version`, `tags`, `visibility`). Categories: `system-prompts`, `agent-instructions`, `templates`, `chains`, `evaluators`.

## Source attribution at a glance

Every invocation row carries a `source` enum that tells the eval engine where the work came from:

| Source | When | Set how |
|---|---|---|
| `skill` | Claude Code session via the broomva-cli skill | `export BROOMVA_SOURCE=skill` |
| `cli` | Terminal user typing `broomva prompts pull ...` | default (no env) |
| `api` | Programmatic wrapper around the CLI | `export BROOMVA_SOURCE=api` |
| `web` | "Copy" button on broomva.tech/prompts/[slug] | server-side, automatic |

Anonymous web copies still write rows (`user_id=null`, only daily-salted `client_ip_hash`). Skill and CLI invocations from authenticated CLI users carry `user_id` from the bearer token.

---

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `BROOMVA_TOKEN` | Bearer auth for the CLI. Get one via `broomva auth login` (device-code flow). |
| `BROOMVA_SOURCE` | `cli` (default) / `skill` / `api`. Sets `source` on every invocation row. |
| `BROOMVA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` | Opt out — no rows are written. Use sparingly; the eval engine starves without volume. |
| `BROOMVA_TELEMETRY_RAW_VARS=1` | Admin-only: send raw variable values instead of SHA-256 hashed. |
| `BROOMVA_API_BASE` | Override API host (default `https://broomva.tech`). |
| `BROOMVA_SESSION_PATH` | Override the per-shell session-id cache (default `~/.broomva/session`). |

## Interaction with bstack primitives

The prompt library composes cleanly with the existing primitive contract:

- **P1 (Conversation Bridge)** — when an agent pulls a prompt and applies it, the entire session is captured in the conversation log. The invocation id appears in the bridge's structured docs, providing a backpointer from "this conversation used prompt X" to the eval engine's run feed.
- **P4 (PR Pipeline)** — when `pr-review-agent` runs on a PR, it should complete the invocation with the real review outcome. Future PR-review prompt versions then have measurable pass rates.
- **P6 (Knowledge Bookkeeping)** — synthesis-worthy prompts (those that compound across multiple agents) get promoted to entity pages in `research/entities/concept/` and `research/entities/pattern/`. The prompt library is the *runtime registry*; the knowledge graph is the *crystallized form*.
- **P11 (Empirical Feedback Loop)** — completing the invocation with real `tokens_in/out`, `latency_ms`, `error_message` is the same discipline as P11: validate with measurable outcomes, not vibes. Step 4 of the mandate IS P11 for prompt invocations.
- **P13 (Dream Cycle)** — the eval engine's evolving rankings are a dream-tier substrate (slow, sparse, high-trust). Per-run telemetry is the dense lower-tier signal; "promote prompt X to a v2 with these tweaks" is the kind of decision that should follow a replay-against-frozen-snapshot pattern, not a live overwrite.

## The evaluation engine (Phase E) — from telemetry to judgment

The 5-step mandate above writes **telemetry**: *what ran* (model, tokens, cost, latency) and *how the human felt* (thumbs). Phase E adds the layer above it — **judgment**: *how good the output actually was*, measured by an LLM-as-judge against versioned rubrics. Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-prompts-evals-engine-design.md`.

What a bstack-driven agent needs to know:

- **Completing an invocation is what triggers an eval.** Step 4 of the mandate (`broomva prompts complete`) is the ingest point. The server applies an adaptive sampling decision (per-rubric YAML config) and, if sampled, enqueues a judge job. The judge — the Life **`krisis`** crate (κρίσις, *judgment*; sibling of `vigil`) — scores the output against a **G-Eval** rubric (each dimension: Definition + Evaluation Steps + Score range + anchors) and writes a `PromptEvaluation` row.
- **Capture the output the cheap way: run the Vigil sidecar.** `broomva vigil install` writes a SessionStart hook and an on-demand local OTLP proxy; point your agent at it via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`OPENAI_BASE_URL` and every LLM call is captured as a GenAI span and joined to the invocation by session-id — no extra step in the loop. Fallback if you don't run the sidecar: `broomva prompts complete --output-file <path>` hands the output over explicitly. No output available → the eval is `skipped` with a reason (a measured coverage gap, never silent).
- **The privacy line is load-bearing: store judgments, never content.** By default the captured output is read transiently to score it, then **dropped** — only scores + reasoning persist. Retention is opt-in (first-party or `sudo` mode) and isolated. Do not design any agent flow that assumes the platform retains the output; it does not, unless capture is explicitly enabled. Entity: `concept/store-judgments-not-content`.
- **Inspect evals from the terminal:**

```bash
broomva evals show <invocation_id> --wait    # block until the judge finishes; print the breakdown
broomva evals list --slug <slug> --failing   # what's scoring poorly
broomva evals tail                           # live feed of completing evals
broomva evals rubric validate <path>         # local YAML lint, no server hit
```

- **`evals show <id> --wait` right after `prompts complete` is the killer loop** — the "did this run actually go well?" answer in the terminal where the work happened.

This deepens the P6/P11/P13 composition above: the eval score is the crystallized quality signal (P6), the judgment is empirical validation of the prompt itself (P11), and the evolving per-prompt aggregate is the dream-tier substrate (P13).

---

## Common traps

- **Pulling a prompt and not completing it.** The most common silent failure. The CLI emits the invocation id loudly; capture it. Set a TodoWrite reminder if the work is long-running.
- **Completing with fake token counts.** The cost computation depends on real numbers. If you don't know exact counts, estimate honestly — never zero-fill.
- **Treating the prompt body as a suggestion.** The directive is a directive. If it conflicts with the user's actual request, surface the conflict — don't silently water down the prompt.
- **Forking a prompt by writing a new variant locally.** If you find yourself editing a pulled prompt to fit your task, that's a signal to push a v2 (or a new slug) to the library so the change is durable.
- **Using `--telemetry-disabled` to silence the beacon.** Defeats the entire point. Only use when working with sensitive content the eval engine should not see, and document the reason.
