// Durable node-state writer (BRO-1914) — persist a node's runtime `state`/`owner` advance to its
// `_work.md` so it SURVIVES A RESTART.
//
// The problem it fixes: a node's runtime state is written DB-only (supervisor `park`, intent verdicts).
// But the FS is authoritative — the scanner re-derives `state` and `owner` from `_work.md` on an
// `--rebuild` rescan (its `CONTENT_KEYS`), so a DB-only advance is LOST on rebuild. A run parked at
// `review` ("Needs you") silently reverts to its dispatch-time state after a restart.
//
// Two earlier naive prototypes were REVERTED (BRO-1913); this writer is built to avoid BOTH:
//   1. A bare uncommitted `_work.md` write DIRTIES the tree → the clean-tree-gated `approveMerge`
//      refuses `dirty_workspace` and WEDGES the F5 gate. → We COMMIT the write (path-scoped), so the
//      tree stays clean.
//   2. A non-atomic `writeFile` of a SCANNED file can be read half-written → `syncNodes` sees a torn
//      file and TOMBSTONES the node (it vanishes from the board). → We write atomically (temp+rename),
//      so a concurrent scanner read sees old-full or new-full, never torn, and rename never removes the
//      file.
//
// All of it runs under the SHARED per-workspace git lock ({@link serializeWorkspaceGit}) so it can
// never interleave with an approve's squash+commit on the same `.git/index`. The commit is a no-pre-`add`
// `git commit -- <path>` ({@link gitCommitPaths}), so a commit fault leaves the INDEX untouched — the ONLY
// undo is the worktree write, rolled back to the exact pre-call bytes. A failed persist thus leaves NOTHING
// half-written and the path clean — then reports `failed` (never a false success). The commit is the transaction.
// The one exception is a DOUBLE fault (commit fails AND the rollback write also fails): the path is then left
// patched-but-uncommitted, and that is reported distinctly as `failed` + `treeDirty` so it is not mistaken for
// a clean-rollback failure (an un-rolled-back `_work.md` wedges every later `approveMerge` with `dirty_workspace`).
