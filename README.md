# Maestro

Maestro is the governance and orchestration metalayer for Broomva's agent fleet. It types what the
fleet already runs on (asks, decisions, work, loops, ticks, initiatives, grants and fleet reports)
and exposes it the same way to every agent harness: a `maestro` CLI and an MCP server.

Maestro sits on top of the existing substrate. It does not replace any of it:

- the fleet skill keeps census, classification and agent-to-agent mail;
- bstack keeps the hooks, gates and primitives;
- `.control/` and `.broomva/loops/` stay the source of truth.

Maestro reads those, computes the views every surface shares (needs, loop drift, context packets),
and injects that context into agent sessions.

This is the Rust successor to the Paseo plugin (`broomva/maestro-paseo`) and the earlier TypeScript
app (archived as `broomva/maestro-legacy`). Design and phases: [`docs/specs/2026-10-18-maestro-rust.html`](docs/specs/2026-10-18-maestro-rust.html).

## Install

```bash
cargo install --locked --path crates/maestro-cli --root ~/.local   # installs ~/.local/bin/maestro
```

## Use

```bash
maestro snapshot                     # counts across the control plane, with read health per section
maestro needs                        # holds on the owner: the "Needs you" list
maestro asks [--project P] [--blocking] [--state open|answered|archived|all]
maestro asks show <ledger.yaml> <id> # one ask in full, with its content hash
maestro asks validate <ledger.yaml>  # runs the workspace's ask_ledger.py, the validator of record
maestro work [--state "Needs you"]   # canonical states: Queued, Running, Stuck, Needs you, Done, Standing
maestro loops [--drifting]           # loop registry joined with tick receipts: drift and notices
maestro initiatives [--all]
maestro fleet
maestro context [--cwd D] [--format markdown|json|hook]
maestro authority                    # what each surface may do, and the standing invariants
maestro hosts                        # known harness capabilities
maestro mcp                          # MCP server on stdio
```

Every command takes `--json`. Agents should use `--json`: it is the same data the MCP tools return,
because the CLI and the MCP server share one dispatch.

By default Maestro reads the workspace at `origin/main`, because main's copy wins under the home rule.
`--tree worktree` reads the local checkout instead. An answer present locally but not on main is
reported as waiting to land, not as open and not as answered.

## Harness registration

| Harness | Registration |
|---|---|
| Claude Code (and T3 Code threads on the Claude provider) | `claude mcp add maestro -s local -- ~/.local/bin/maestro mcp` |
| Codex (and T3 Code threads on the Codex provider) | `[mcp_servers.maestro] command = "~/.local/bin/maestro"`, `args = ["mcp"]` in `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| Any MCP client | stdio: `maestro mcp` |

Context injection through a hook, for example Claude Code `SessionStart`:

```json
{ "type": "command", "command": "~/.local/bin/maestro context --format hook --stdin --event SessionStart" }
```

The hook path never fails a session. On any error it prints nothing and exits 0.

Before 2026-10-18 both registrations pointed at the T3 MCP proof of concept,
`bun apps/maestro-paseo-t3-mcp-ui/mcp/server.ts`. The Claude Code entry also passed `--demo`.

## Environment

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `MAESTRO_WORKSPACE` | `~/broomva` |
| `MAESTRO_TREE` | `origin/main` |
| `MAESTRO_WORK_ROOT` | `workRoot` from `~/.config/maestro-paseo/config.json`, else `~/maestro` |
| `BROOMVA_HOME` | `~/.broomva` |
| `MAESTRO_FLEET_STATE` | `~/.local/state/fleet-reconcile` |

## Layout

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `maestro-core` | Typed domain, no I/O: work states and transitions, asks, needs, loops and drift, ticks and due tiers, initiatives, grants, fleet, host-namespaced sessions, authority, context packets |
| `maestro-store` | Readers for the on-disk control plane (working tree or a git revision) and the shared views |
| `maestro-mcp` | MCP server: read tools, the `maestro_context` prompt, and `maestro://` resources |
| `maestro-cli` | The `maestro` binary |

## Develop

```bash
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

Tests run against `fixtures/machine/`, a miniature machine layout, so they never touch real ledgers.

Design system: `DESIGN.md` and `design-system/broomva/` are the Broomva foundation profile. Work-state
labels in `maestro-core::work::WorkState` are the canonical agentic-work vocabulary, and they are tested.
